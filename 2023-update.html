  <a href="https://zefi.network/">https://zefi.network/</a> - Zefi Network initiative did a Coin Burn and 390,096.75420564 $ZCL
  were forever burned at this address t1ZefiGenesisBootstrapBURNxxxyfs71k
  </a>
  Development was started on an initiative to make Zclassic Cross Chain
      <br>
      Zefi Token on Eth: <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x484de83cbc88566e9e13eb97f4717a0803809240"> Zefi Eth</a>

      <h3>Jan 8 2023</h3>
      <p>Code for "8ball" was announced via serveral immutable arweave links using git-SHA256.  
        <br>
        
        Note: it is not possible to host git-SHA256 repositories on Github, Gitlab, etc.
      <br>
        
        "8ball" is the <b>first known implementation of GG20 One-Round Threshold Signatures with Keygen over a public Blockchain</b>
      <br>
      8ball is based on the latest Cosmos SDK technology
        
<br>
        The decentralized 8ball cosmos network can coordinate and generate shared elliptic points on the Secp256k1 curve.
        <br>
  Such points can be used as private keys and addresses can be derived on the Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron, Dodegecoin, Litecoin, Zclassic... and hundreds of other networks that use the Secp256k1 elliptic curve for their addresses.
        
        <br>
8ball magic address transactions use the lowest possible amount of gas because they appear as single simple transactions and not multisig or script.

        <h3>What is Next?</h3>
  
  <p>
    8ball network has still not launched.  8ball tokens will be bootstrapped from a $ZEFI and $ZCL combined ongoing burn
    <br>
    For example: when $ZEFI sent is to "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead"
    <br>
    like this
<a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa52bc6956a1f434d6ed31b43cad9600245c6ef7f30811263e136d67510ee2772">
  100,000 $ZEFI BURNED
    </a>
    <br>
    100,000 8ball will be sent to an address that can be controlled using the same private key that was used on ethereum.
    <br>
    You control your own private keys always, do not lose them.
